Idea behind this doc is to store all usefull knowledge I gain in Web Dev field in a consize matter in one place.
Basically idea is to categorize and write-down each article link with one sentence describing it's essence.

# Testing

- (From PayPal dev) **Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.** Unless you develop small lib, don't try to reach 100% test coverage, avoid testing impl details because it doesnâ€™t give you 
very much confidence that your app is working and it slows you down when refactoring, see details 
[here](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/write-tests-not-too-many-mostly-integration-5e8c7fff591c)
- (From PayPal dev) **Use [data-attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)** to make relationship 
between source and testing code more explicit to not break tests when markup changes, see details 
[here](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/making-your-ui-tests-resilient-to-change-d37a6ee37269)
- **Cucumber/Gherkin is [my choice](https://github.com/device-hackers/browser-ui-state/tree/master/features)** for at least 
system tests (aka end-to-end), see details: [1](https://www.sitepoint.com/bdd-javascript-cucumber-gherkin/),

- **Gherkin feature files should be written by QA** (not BA/PO or Devs), see details [here](https://habrahabr.ru/post/275013/) (RU)

# Conventions
- **Don't use semicolons and double quotes in JS** to facilitate better readability, e.g.
